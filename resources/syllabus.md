**Office Hours**: MW 4:30-5:30pm and Th 12:30-2pm in ECOT 731 or by appointment

### Course Description 

Computers have made it possible, even easy, to collect vast amounts of data from a wide variety
of sources. It is not always clear, however, how to use those data and how to extract useful information from
data. This problem is faced in a tremendous range of scholarly, government, business, medical, and scientific
applications. The goal of this course is to review the principles of allowing machines to make sense of these data
in a mathematically rigorous way. By the end of this course, you'll be able to take a problem and analyze it to
determine which machine learning techniques are appropriate for solving the problem, how to prepare data to use
that solution, apply the solution, and to evaluate the results. For the most common machine learning techniques,
you'll also be able to implement solutions in Python.

### Textbook 

We will use various free online sources throughout the semester:

- [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online) by Barber 
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James et. al. 
- [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) by Hastie et. al. 

### Course Web Page 

This term we will be using Piazza ([https://piazza.com/colorado/spring2018/csci5622](https://piazza.com/colorado/spring2018/csci5622))for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the grader, and the instructor. **Rather than emailing me questions, I request that you to post your questions on Piazza**.  If your question is of a private nature, Piazza allows you to send me a private message. It is your responsibility to check the web page on a regular basis. Here you will find detailed information such as news, homework assignments and solutions, and instructor office hours. 

### Distance Degree Access 

Students enrolled in the distance section of CSCI 5622 that wish to join the lecture synchronously should use the Zoom Meeting ID 244-684-814. 

### Computing

We will make extensive use of the Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks. It is estimated that around 50% of practicing data scientists do most of their analysis using Python (while the other roughly 50% use R, which we shall not speak of).  The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based programming environment that allows you to seamlessly mix Python code (as well as many other languages), graphics, and exposition (in Markdown).  The Jupyter Notebook has become ubiquitous in the data science community for rapidly prototyping ideas and sharing them with colleagues and the rest of the world.  

It is strongly recommended that you install Python 3 and Jupyter on your local machine. By far, the easiest way to do this is by installing the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python 3.6.  This distribution comes with many Python packages useful for data science and scientific computation in general. It also comes with Jupyter by default.

Frequently in class we will explore computational problems directly in Jupyter notebooks.  It is highly recommended that you bring a laptop with you to class, however it's perfectly acceptable that you team up with a classmate on a single computer. 

### Coursework 

**Homework**: You will be given homework periodically throughout the course. These assignments are designed to help you learn the material, so please use them for that! All assignments will be completed and submitted in Jupyter Notebooks. You are allotted **THREE** late days that may be used for homework over the entire semester. Submitting an assignment between 1 second and 23 hrs, 59 minutes, 59 seconds late constitutes 1 late day.  After you have expended your allotted late days late homework will **NOT** be accepted or graded. **Your lowest homework score will be dropped**. 

**Reading Quizzes**: Most lectures will have an associated online "quiz" due roughly 24 hours after class.  These will consist of 
one or two short problems based on the reading and lecture material from the previous day.  You may use any reasonable resources 
available to you (lecture slides, class notes, reading material, the internet) but you should work the problems on your own.  These
will not be terribly difficult, and are primarily designed to keep you honest with respect to attending class and keeping up with
the reading.  No extensions or make-up quizzes will be given but I will drop 10% of your lowest quiz scores (e.g. if we end up
having 20 reading quizzes then I will drop your two lowest scores.)

**In-Class Midterm**: There will be an in-class midterm on March 14th. You will be allowed one standard size sheet (front
and back) of handwritten notes on the midterm exam. It is highly encouraged that you bring a cheap four-function calculator 
to the exam.  Fancy graphing calculators, cell phones, or any other device that can connect to the internet or store a large 
amount of data are not permitted. 

**Semester Project**: You will complete a semester-long group project (in groups of 4-5) that
investigates an advanced Machine Learning technique and/or application of interest to you. Details about the semester
project and import **milestones** can be found [here](https://github.com/chrisketelsen/CSCI5622-Machine-Learning/blob/master/resources/project.md).

### Grade Determination 

The overall grades will be based on a cumulative score computed from 

* The homework (35% of the grade)
* The reading quizzes (10% of the grade)
* The midterm exam (25% of the grade)
* The semester project (30% of the grade)

Unless adjustments are necessary, letter grades will be assigned using the standard grading scale: 

| Letter | Raw Average |
|--------|-------------|
|     A  |   93-100    |
|     A- |   90-92     |
|     B+ |   87-89     |
|     B  |   83-86     |
|     B- |   80-82     |
|     C+ |   77-79     |
|     C  |   73-76     |
|     C- |   70-72     |
|     D+ |   67-69     |
|     D  |   63-66     |
|     D- |   60-62     |
|     F  |   00-59     |

### Collaboration Policy 

The collaboration policy is simple:

* **Inspiration is free**: you may discuss homework assignments with anyone. You are especially encouraged to discuss solutions with your instructor and your classmates.

* **Plagiarism is forbidden**: the assignments **and code** that you turn in should be written entirely on your own. You should not need to consult sources beyond your textbook, class notes, posted lecture slides and notebooks, Python/Sklearn/Numpy documentation, and online sources for _basic_ techniques. Copying/soliciting a solution to a problem from the internet or another classmate constitutes a violation of the course's collaboration policy and the honor code and will result in an **F** in the course and a trip to the honor council.

* **Do not search for a solution on-line**: You may not actively search for a solution to the problem from the internet. This includes posting to sources like StackExchange, Reddit, Chegg, etc. 

* **StackExchange Clarification**: Searching for basic techniques in Pandas/Sklearn/Numpy is totally fine.  If you want to post and ask "How do I group by two columns, then do something, then group by a third column" that's fine.  What you **cannot** do is post "Here's the DataFrame my prof gave me.  I need to convert **Age** in Earth years to Martian years and then predict the person's favorite color.  **Give me code!**".  That's cheating, yo. 

* **When in doubt, ask**: If you have doubts about this policy or would like to discuss specific cases, please ask the instructor.

### Standard Course Policies
