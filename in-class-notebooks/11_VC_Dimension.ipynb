    "\n",
    "It was stated in the lecture that the VC Dimension of a linear classifier with data in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ is $D+1$.  In this problem you will prove this result, first by proving that there exists a set of $D+1$ points that can be shattered, and then by proving that there does not exist a set of $D+2$ points that can be shattered. \n",

    "The general form of our classifier is $h_{\\bf w}({\\bf x}) = I_{{\\bf w}^T{\\bf x} \\geq 0}$, i.e. $h_{\\bf w}$ classifies an example ${\\bf x}$ as positive if ${\\bf w}^T{\\bf x} \\geq 0$ and negative otherwise. Note that here we have (as usual) prepended the ${\\bf x}$ vector with a $1$ corresponding to the bias term.  Thus both ${\\bf w}$ and ${\\bf x}$ live in $\\mathbb{R}^{D+1}$.  We'll assume that our labels are $y_i \\in \\{1,-1\\}$ corresponding to ${\\bf w}^T{\\bf x} \\geq 0$ and ${\\bf w}^T{\\bf x} < 0$, respectively. \n",

    "**Q**: In the first step, we want to show that there exists $D+1$ vectors ${\\bf x}_i$ such that $\\textrm{sign}({\\bf w}^T{\\bf x_i}) = y_i$ for any labeling of $y_i$.  Argue that we can test the suitability of a proposed set of $D+1$ vectors by an equivalent matrix equation of the form $X{\\bf w} = {\\bf y}$.   "
