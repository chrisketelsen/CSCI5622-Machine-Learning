    "\n",
    "Recall that we commonly include in the log-likelihood function a regularization term (on all weights except for the bias) of the form $\\lambda \\sum_{k=1}^D w_k^2$.   Incidentally, there are many forms of regularization.  This one is called L2-regularization because it can also be written as $\\lambda\\|{\\bf w}_{1:D}\\|_2^2$ where the norm here is the 2-norm or the *Euclidean* norm. For SGA this has the effect of including a term like $2\\lambda w_k$ in the $k^\\textrm{th}$ component of the gradient. \n",

    "**A**: Remember that the features in text learning with the Bag-of-Words model are all of the words in the vocabulary.  Since most documents will not have anywhere near the number of words in the vocabulary, feature vectors in text learning tend to be **very** sparse.  Furthermore, since $\\nabla_{\\bf w}NLL({\\bf w})$ is effectively a multiple of the feature vector ${\\bf x}_i$, it will have the same sparsity pattern (i.e. still a ton of zeros).  This means that in unregularized SGA there is no need to update the weight vector corresponding to features that are zero in ${\\bf x}_i$  (we often call these **zero-dimensions** or **zero-features**). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we add regularization to the mix, it complicates matters.  The features affected by regularization are the features where the **weight vector** is nonzero.  By the end of training a Logistic Regression model on a large document corpus, a great many entries in the weight vector will likely be nonzero. If we include regularization in the update, we'll have to update tremendously more features in ${\\bf w}$ than just the nonzero features from ${\\bf x}_i$ at each step.   "
